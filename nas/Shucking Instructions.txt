Shucking is the term used for taking apart an External Hard Drive and adding the Internal Hard Drive that was inside it into your PC/NAS.

Requirements:
- Old unused Credit Card or 4 Guitar Picks
- Flathead Screwdriver
- Phillips Head Screwdriver
- T10 Torx Screwdriver or Pliers
- Electrical Tape + Scissors

1. Cut the Credit Card into 4 pieces or use 4 Guitar Picks. Slide each piece into the edges of the External Hard Drive.
2. Take 1 of the 4 pieces and slide it into the side near the back of the hard drive.
3. Use the Flathead Screwdriver and slide it into the same spot. Use force to nudge the hard drive out of the case.
4. Once the hard drive is out, it will be inside another rectangular case. You can easily push the hard drive out of this.
5. Use the Phillips Head Screwdriver to unscrew the attached piece that's covering the SATA slot.
6. If the hard drive has 4 outer screws on the sides, use the T10 Torx Screwdriver or Pliers to unscrew those.
7. Place the hard drive into the drive bay and screw it in. Then place the drive bay into the PC/NAS.

The 3.3v Issue:
If the hard drive does not power on and cannot be read, it's probably because of the 3.3v issue.
1. Unplug the hard drive and locate the 3rd pin from the left of the SATA power slot. (see images or videos online)
2. Use Electrical Tape and cut a small piece wide enough to cover the 3rd pin. (The 1st and 2nd pins aren't used so they can also be covered.)
3. The piece should be long enough to wrap along the underside of the pin.
4. Place the tape onto the pin and apply pressure on the top and bottom. Use a Flathead Screwdriver to apply pressure on the bottom.
Note: If the hard drive still does not power on, you will need a Molex to SATA Power Adapter (DO NOT get the molded ones)
