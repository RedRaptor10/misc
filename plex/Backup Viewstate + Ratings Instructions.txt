The watched/unwatched, view progress, and ratings are stored in an install-independent fashion that makes them easy to move between installations or servers.

Before you do anything, make sure that the Plex Media Server is not actively running on either the source or destination install.

1. Download sqlite3 from:

https://www.sqlite.org/download.html

2. Navigate to Precompiled Binaries for Windows and download sqlite-tools-win-32-x86-3250300.zip

3. Unpack files to folder (ie. C:\sqlite)

4. Run CMD and change directory to Plex Media Server database:

cd %LOCALAPPDATA%\Plex Media Server\Plug-in Support\Databases

5. Export database settings:

C:\sqlite\sqlite3.exe com.plexapp.plugins.library.db ".dump metadata_item_settings" > settings.sql

6. In new destination, empty old data:

C:\sqlite\sqlite3.exe com.plexapp.plugins.library.db "DELETE FROM metadata_item_settings;"

7. Import database settings:

C:\sqlite\sqlite3.exe com.plexapp.plugins.library.db ".read settings.sql"
